           <content id="about-story"><p>What's up? I'm Chad.  I am self taught Systems Analyst based out of Nashville, TN. My passion for technology started as a kid. My life's motivation to learn new technology has forged a career path from troubleshooting break fix issues to Corporate Systems Analysis. I have decided my newest journey is to tackle Web Development. All of my extra time has gone into learning web based coding technology.</p>
          <p>I am currently taking on some small projects to build a portfolio that is worthy of your time. To this point, I have worked with templated sites such as Wordpress, Shopify, and Squarespace. This personal site has been developed from the ground up and is my first completed project.</p>
          <p>My current coding skills include HTML5 and CSS3. The future plan is to dive into JavaScript and then dig into more backend solutions. My end goal, for now, is to have the knowledge of a full stack developer.</p> </content>
