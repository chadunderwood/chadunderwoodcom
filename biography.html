          <p>What's up? I'm Chad. </p>
          <p>A self taught Systems Analyst based out of Nashville, TN.</p>
          <p>My passion for technology started as a kid. 
            My life's motivation is to learn new technology. This motivation forged a career path from troubleshooting system issues to Corporate Systems Analysis. 
            My newest journey is to learning Web Development.</p>
          <p>Until now, I have worked with templated sites such as Wordpress, Shopify, and Squarespace. 
            My first completed project is this site. It has been developed from the ground up by me. </p>
          <p>My current skills include HTML5 and CSS3. 
            I plan to dive into JavaScript, then dig into more backend solutions. 
            My end goal is to have the knowledge of a full stack developer.</p>
