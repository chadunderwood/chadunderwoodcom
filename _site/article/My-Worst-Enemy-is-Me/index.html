<p>Most of my life, I spent my quiet time coming up with ideas. Matter of fact, I have a ton of ideas. For those that know me well, I am a very analytical person.I analyze everything around me, constantly. When you meet me, I am very quiet. I am quiet because I am analyzing everything.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I hold myself back from speaking. I do this because I don’t want to say something stupid. I lack confidence in social situations.</p>

<h3 id="the-great-procrastinator">The Great Procrastinator</h3>

<p>I have one other thing that I hold myself back from, action. I tend to be a procrastinator. I always meet deadlines but scramble to get them done at the last minute.</p>

<p>I spend hours analyzing how to do something. I have to know everything before I can get started. I have found, what causes this procrastination for me.</p>

<h3 id="paralyzed">Paralyzed</h3>

<p>Once I feel like I know everything about a subject, then comes the what I need to get started. Here’s what those look like.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I need a new camera to start that YouTube channel.</li>
  <li>I need more followers to start that newsletter.</li>
  <li>I can’t post this on Instagram because its not a perfect picture.</li>
  <li>What if someone doesn’t like it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The procrastination is not laziness. My procrastination is from fear of failure. This fear is paralyzing. Especially, for a person that lacks self confidence. I don’t want to be seen as a failure.</p>

<h3 id="comfortable-with-uncomfortable">Comfortable with uncomfortable</h3>

<p>My wife on the other hand is super confident. I think that confidence is what draws me to her. We are the proverbial yin and yang.</p>

<p>She drives me to want more from life. At first, I rejected this because it wasn’t normal to just do something that wasn’t planned out. Now, I have become somewhat comfortable with being uncomfortable.</p>

<h3 id="stuck-on-the-diving-board">Stuck on the diving board</h3>

<p>After much reflection here’s what I found. If I just start, the voices, in my head, have no influence over me.</p>

<p>If I wait until I feel ready, I never get started.  Here’s a good quote I came across from somewhere, “If you wait for the perfect temperature in the pool, you’ll always be left standing on the diving board.”</p>

<p>I have read many biographies of, who I would deem, successful people. I have found these people all have the same trait. They start without knowing the how.</p>

<p>Successful people, start and learn as they go. Then, they surround themselves with people who can teach them.</p>

<h3 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h3>

<p>I have started to make myself do things. I’m still here. I’m not embarrassed. My failures are learning experiences.</p>

<p>I now fail in public more. You didn’t even see they happened. In the grand scheme of things, other people are not paying attention.</p>

<p>My self confidence is higher than ever. I’m moving forward and excited where this road will take me.</p>

<p>I hope you can find more confidence to start. Starting is the most important thing. Once you start, the rest falls in place. You’re not lazy.</p>

<p>If you enjoyed this please tell your friends! (it would seriously mean the world to me)</p>
