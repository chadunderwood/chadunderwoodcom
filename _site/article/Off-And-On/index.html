      <h1>Off and On</h1><h2> My Journey in Tech. </h2>

      <div class="post-container">
        <content> <p>This journey started in High School. I knew I was going to work in tech. Tech was the one passion I have always had, specifically computers. I had taken every single computer class I could. Then came my senior year and Advanced MIS. I always excelled in MIS. I passed everything with 100%. Then came my final assignment.</p>

<p>All I had to do was build an application in VB (Visual basic for you young cats). I decided that I was going to make a black jack game. It seemed like it would use everything that we had learned in the class that year. We had 6 weeks to get it working. On the last day of the class, Chad’s version of Black Jack didn’t work. It was that day, I knew coding was not for me and I said I would never try again.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have seen people post their personal portfolio websites and I knew I had to have one. I have wanted my own space where I fully owned my data. A site, unlike social media, where I control everything. The truth is I have had an idea of what I wanted my site to look like. I have searched to the end of the web and back to find a theme that would fit all the little details. So I decided to restart on my coding journey.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>In 2017, I found <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a>. Their site makes learning the basics of HTML and CSS easy. They walk you through learning bits and pieces at a time and it was easy for me. I was on the track to learning as quickly and as much as I could. Amazingly, one of the projects there is to create a personal portfolio site. I  was able to complete almost all of the content they were offering for a Front-End developer certificate. Then I was distracted by the blessing of a new child and life. So back off the track I went.</p>

<h3 id="moving-ahead">Moving Ahead</h3>
<p>Fast forward, to this year (2020), we are once again expecting a new child. My wife has decided to go back to school and I needed something to fill my extra time. I still have the itch to create that personal website. I went back to freecodecamp.org and rushed through all of the tutorials once again to refresh. So now I am back on track and motivated more than ever.</p>

<p>What has made this time different than the others? I  found a great community on Twitter that motivates me. They are mostly experienced developers preaching the gospel of development. By preaching I mean, they let newer developers know the truth about development. They cut through the self depreciating thoughts, that you don’t know enough to be a compentent developer.</p>

<p>Truth be known, I already knew this about tech; but failed to realize it about development. I always just assumed every developer knew most everything, about a language, before they started really doing development. Personally, I have been in the tech field for 13 years and I got my start by Googling everything. Now that I am more seasoned, I don’t have to Google as much but a search engine is my best friend. However, I found that a lot of the senior developers are just Googlers with experience; just like me. This made learning to code seem easier and obtainable.</p>

<h3 id="where-i-am-now">Where I Am Now</h3>
<p>Over these months, I have been working to take in little by litte. The difference, this time, has been knowing that I need to be steady and learn when I can. The fact, I don’t have to know everything just puts me at ease. Cramming has never been my strong suit because I tend to burn out fast (and it seems others do too)!</p>

<p>In the past 3 months, I have been able to retain more than I ever have before and it all is just starting to make sense. In the past, things never seemed to connect. I could make things happen but nothing like now. I am actually releasing my site to the world and it is <strong>EXCITING!!!</strong></p>

<p>I have a few projects lined out that should continue raise my confidence level. These projects will allow me to continue to learn new things but with deadlines involved, just like a developer would. It is exciting to know, this time, I stand a chance to make it! For those in #100daysofcode, you will make it too, if you stick with it.</p>
