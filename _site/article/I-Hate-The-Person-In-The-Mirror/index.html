<p>Ever heard the cliché, you are the people you surround yourself with? I know I sure have. In life, I have found by changing the people around me, I have changed the way of my life’s progression.</p>

<p>We have been teaching my oldest son about choosing the people around him wisely. As I said before, he is starting high school this coming fall. He is at the age where kids are generally the most impressionable by their peers. In my life, I have noticed that most people don’t keep an eye on the people around them. My belief is this is what keeps people down.</p>

<h3 id="the-influence-of-others">The influence of others</h3>
<p>People can be easily influenced. Don’t believe me, take a look around your house. How many things do you see that are a name brand, you saw on TV, or social media? I’m not here to judge you. Currently, I am sitting in Nike clothes and Nike shoes. Why? “I wanna be like Mike.” Just kidding, but that is where it started for me.</p>

<p>I am not a psychiatrist but I am guessing it starts as soon as we are born. Humans naturally learn by watching others. We start walking and talking because we see our parents doing it. Our culture learns from those people around us.</p>

<p><strong>These people can be broken into 3 different groups:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Friends and Family</li>
  <li>Community (Our peer group)</li>
  <li>Influencers (Celebrities)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is why your parents have probably said to you, “If so and so jumped over a bridge, would you do it too?” Unfortunately, in some aspects of our lives the answer is yes. This can be a good thing or a bad thing.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-the-person-in-the-mirror">Who is the person in the mirror?</h3>
<p>It is up to us to determine what is good and what is bad. In terms of our topic, it is up to us to determine what to mentality and influence to keep around. The people directly around us have the most influence and luckily, we control who we spend the most time with.</p>

<p>Now for the hard work, self reflection.</p>

<p>How do you see yourself?</p>

<p>Are you negative? Are you poor? Are you unhappy? Do you lack confidence?</p>

<p>Now look at the 5 people closest to you. Do you see any similarities? Most likely you do.</p>

<p>Next decide what part of you, needs to change. Let’s say you want to be more positive.</p>

<p>Now find at least one person in your peer group, who seems to be always positive. Start hanging with this person more than one other person in your group of 5. Now you need to spend less time with the most negative person in your life.</p>

<h3 id="the-beginning-of-change">The Beginning of Change</h3>

<p>Letting someone go doesn’t mean you hate them, it just means you need better influence in your life. This doesn’t have to be permanent. You need someone with a different focus right now. You don’t have to stop talking to them. You might just need to stop talking to them so frequently.</p>

<p>Everyone has that one negative person, let’s call them Negative Nancy (sorry Nancy it works for this example and you’re probably a really nice lady). When you talk to her, you find yourself hearing all the bad things in her world. Ultimately, you walk away feeling worse. To help you become more positive, you have to change the frequency of contact with Negative Nancy. This helps you stay positive more of the time.</p>

<p>This applies to many other aspects of life. Continue to evaluate the closest 5 people to you. Want to be successful or work out more? Find a successful person or person that constantly works out. Start to hang out with these people more. You will slowly start to see your focus change. You will become more like the people you choose to be around.</p>

<p>I have done this subconsciously and consciously throughout my life (even accidentally). Every time, I have started to change those around me, I have major changes in my life. Emotionally it’s hard to do and takes a lot of self reflection and self awareness to complete.  In the end, you have to love yourself before you can love others. This is one small step to becoming a better you.</p>
