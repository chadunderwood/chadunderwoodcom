<p>If I gave titles to the decades of my life, my 30’s would be, “The Decade Of Self Reflection”. In my reflection, I have found my mindset to be my biggest set back. I have consistently been my own antagonist.</p>

<h3 id="my-reflection">My Reflection.</h3>
<p>Time and time again, I set myself up for complacency. I would talk myself out of action. I always had excuses for why I couldn’t do something. I never asked, “How can I do this?”</p>

<p>Here’s some examples. I don’t have time. I don’t understand that. I’ll look into that. Other people will think its dumb. Sound familiar? These are the phrases we tell ourselves to stay lazy.</p>

<p>If I made it through these excuses, the possibility of failure set in. I would not allow myself to fail. Failure was not an option. Again, another defense mechanism to keep myself lazy.</p>

<p>The more and more I hear stories of successful people, I realize they do 2 things. First they ask themselves, “ What can I do?” Then they fail and learn from the mistakes. They take action.</p>

<h3 id="heres-what-happened-for-me">Here’s what happened for me.</h3>
<p>I changed my mindset from a statement to asking a question. Now I ask, “Why I can’t?”, instead of saying, “Why I can’t.” Notice they are the same set of words with different punctuation. Asking myself a question requires me to respond. A statement doesn’t. The statement shuts down the idea instantly. See how that works? Changing the punctuation, changes the mindset and the reaction.</p>

<p>This small mindset change, changed the reflection and my reaction. In reality, I could’ve always done these things, but I was just too lazy to try. I was too busy making excuses instead of being busy trying.</p>

<p>Now I just try most things and see what happens. I have tried so many things and failed. I have started blogs, tried video game streaming, Facebook groups, Reddit communities, Instagram accounts, and businesses.</p>

<p>From these failures, I have learned what my actual passions are and how to keep them fueled. Also, I have learned things that were unexpected such as marketing, forming communities, copy writing, and leveraging social media. I am still learning.</p>

<h3 id="your-mindset-is-your-reflection">Your mindset is your reflection.</h3>
<p>Most importantly, I have learned that my mindset is the reflection I see. I am sure there is something that has been in the back of your mind that you want to accomplish. Ask yourself, “How can I do this?”. The answer that comes to mind, give it a try. I bet your reflection changes too. Before too long you will strike gold. I believe in you!</p>
