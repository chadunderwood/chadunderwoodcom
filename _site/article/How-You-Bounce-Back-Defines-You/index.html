<p>My family and I finished The Last Dance documentary this week and for me it was so good. (No spoilers) It was nice to relive my childhood and see some of the great plays that they made. The sound of their intro music still gets me pumped. But there was so much more to the documentary other than the happenings on the court.</p>

<p>The deep dive into Jordan’s personality is what stood out most to me. He is a winner and wanted to win at all cost. This is what made him a champion, but his flaws are what made him great. Never once did I see Jordan blame anyone else for the shortcomings. Instead he learned from the losses and came back better.</p>

<p>Jordan is not the greatest because of the rings or the MVPs he earned. He is the greatest because of how he bounced back from the losses. His goal was to always improve and he did. That’s why he is the greatest of all time.</p>

<p>For me, the take away from this documentary is never let defeat bring you down; instead, take the defeat and use it to motivate you to be better. It’s cliche but practice makes perfect and no one practiced more than Jordan. Defeat for him was only temporary.</p>

<p>A lot of people can take defeat hard, including me. I can hang on the negatives for too long and let them get into my head. Instead we should push through the negatives, take accountability and just move on. Sitting on the negatives doesn’t get anything done. Instead we should strive to fix those things that we can and let everything else go. This is something I have been working on for a while and has brought major improvements to my quality of life.</p>

<p>I hope this documentary can be a lesson for someone out there that is struggling to get back up from defeat. Take your defeat with pride and come back stronger. Defeat is only temporary but how you bounce back is what defines you. Let’s go into this long weekend with a new attitude and “Be Like Mike.”</p>
