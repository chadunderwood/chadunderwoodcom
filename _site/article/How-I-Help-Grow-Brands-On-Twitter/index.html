        <div id="post-container">
          <content><p>In August, I started working with Decade Investor. Decade Investor was started as a brand to promote investing to a younger crowd. Its run by Kolin Hayes, who is teaching what he’s learned over the years about dividend investing.</p>

<p>When I came on board, Decade Investor was a Twitter account with a few thousand followers. We’ve since transformed the Twitter account into a thriving 14,000+ community.</p>

<h3 id="mentored-beginnings">Mentored Beginnings</h3>

<p>When I work with a new prospect, I dig to find the whole picture.</p>

<p>After some research, I realized there was more than just a Twitter account. Kolin had a landing page, YouTube channel, eBook, and Podcast. All had good followings, but with different branding.</p>

<p><strong>Production had stopped</strong> everywhere except on Twitter. <strong>He was losing momentum on the other platforms. This was the wrong play.</strong></p>

<p>There was no reason to lose these followers. <strong>We wanted the momentum in all places to continue.</strong> So I told him to start all production back up.</p>

<p>YouTube and podcast episodes are great places for evergreen content.</p>

<p>Now I understood what assets he had and everything was back running. It was time to move forward. Time to start bringing everything together.</p>

<p>His YouTube channel teaches investing. Rebranding YouTube was the natural first action. He took care of the rebrand. Now it falls in line with the brand.</p>

<p>The podcast is about motivation. It doesn’t following the investing topic. We decided the branding of this was best left alone. But it would brought on board via the next move.</p>

<h3 id="connecting-the-pieces">Connecting the pieces</h3>

<p>The next move was a domain name. The natural choice was decadeinvestor.com. <strong>This is crown jewel of his brand.</strong> He made the purchase and we moved to the landing page.</p>

<p>The landing page is central point for his audience. <strong>The landing page connects all of the online accounts in one central location.</strong> We connected his new domain name to the landing page. So now when you go to <a href="http://decadeinvestor.com">decadeinvestor.com</a> you are greeted with everything you need to know about the brand. From product offering to where else Kolin can be found.</p>

<h3 id="instagram-effect">Instagram Effect</h3>

<p>We noticed his Twitter posts were being put on Instagram. I knew, it was time to add more. I told him to create an Instagram account. At my direction he start engaging with these posts including his content. Almost overnight, he had 500 followers. He’s posting daily on Instagram. Now there’s almost 1400 followers and he’s growing fast.</p>

<h3 id="the-future">The Future</h3>

<p>A self hosted website in the works. This site allows expansion of the brand further. It’s a place for articles and monetization. Blog articles will draw his audience closer and allow SEO to bring a larger community.</p>

<h3 id="proof-is-in-the-results">Proof is in the Results</h3>
<p>With my mentoring. Kolin has taken a solitary Twitter account to a full fledged brand. His brand is now serving a growing community of 14,000+.
The best part? 
The brand is everywhere the people are.</p>
