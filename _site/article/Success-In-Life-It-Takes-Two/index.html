<h3 id="some-backstory">Some Backstory</h3>
<p>Some of you may not know my back story, so let me share. I am a Dad to 4 great boys with a girl on the way. We spend a ton of time teaching life lessons. Our oldest son is 15 and starting high school this year. We have been trying to help him understand this year starts real life. Our next eldest son is 11 and we are working on accountability for your actions. Our 6 year old, has been learning how to be a good teammate as he starts his first season of baseball. Last but not least, our youngest is 3 and learning manners. Around my house, two topics keep popping up and I feel everyone would benefit from a refresher.</p>

<h3 id="showing-up">SHOWING UP</h3>
<p>I realize as I get older, two things are more important than anything else. I believe, wholeheartedly, if you show up and pay attention you will be ahead of 90% of people. Showing up and paying attention are building blocks for trust in all types of relationships. Luckily, both characteristics are controlled by you.</p>

<p>Everyone knows a person, who says, “I’ll be there.”, then you don’t hear from them until weeks later. You actually make other plans, ahead of time, because you don’t trust they will show up. In life, you don’t want to be known as this person. Nobody trusts this person because they can’t be counted on when they are truly needed. You don’t want to be seen as this person or your chance will never happen.</p>

<p>You never really understand the affect not showing up can have on other people. I was reminded by a friend, just this past weekend, of people not showing up for his birthday but my taking the time to be there. 5 years later he is still thankful for me just being present for him. This was a huge deal for him and for me I was just doing what I agreed to. As the old saying goes, people will never forget how you made them feel. Just showing up can make a huge impact.</p>

<h3 id="swing-and-a-miss">Swing and a Miss!</h3>
<p>Life is basically a bunch of at bats. You can’t swing if you’re not in the stadium and you lose by default. The more you show up the more chances you have to succeed. Each time you show up, you are one step closer to success. Gen. George S. Patton said “Opportunities do not come to those who wait. They are captured by those who attack.” This could’ve easily have said, “Opportunities do not come to those who wait. They are captured by those who show up.” and still had the exact same meaning. Basically, show up and seize your chance swing.</p>

<h3 id="no-such-thing-as-an-overnight-success">No such thing as an overnight success.</h3>
<p>You hear of overnight successes but rarely do you hear of the years of blood, sweat and tears they put in to being an “overnight success.” They show up for every opportunity until their day comes. These people are present at the right moment, so they are able to seize the moment and take the prize.</p>

<p>I love reading and listening to successful entrepreneurs, celebrities, and other people’s climb to the top. I have found that there is always one common thing they share, showing up. Last week I wrote about Michael Jordan and his responding to failure. Did you know he didn’t make his high school team the first year he tried out? What was his response? He showed up the next year and made the team and changed the basketball landscape forever. What would basketball be like if Mike had sat at home because he didn’t make it the first time?</p>

<p>Another good example is Bobby Bones, who is a national radio show host and mentor on American Idol. Bobby knew he wanted to be in radio, so he started in high school. He was a janitor for a local radio station. Everyday, he showed up and took advantage of the small opportunities to learn about radio. One day, the station’s normal DJ didn’t show up and he got his shot. Years later, he has one of the most listened to shows in the country. Obviously, the end success was still more hard work but the point is Bobby Bones wouldn’t be who he is today if he didn’t do the most simple thing, show up.</p>

<p>There are countless other people, I could list. Basically, go find a CEO, musician, celebrity, athlete or other successful person and read their story. You will see a story of how one day they showed up and everything aligned. There is no luck in life, just showing up for your moment.</p>

<p>In conclusion, you have to make the most of the time you have. Time is the one thing that we can’t get back. The more time you waste, the less you can achieve. If you’re not showing up, then all you are doing is wasting your time and probably other people’s time.</p>
