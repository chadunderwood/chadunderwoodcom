<p>The other day my 3 year old wanted a toy from behind the couch. He kept on and on until I stopped what I was doing to get the toy. Why was he so persistent? He knew that eventually I would give in as long as he was persistent.</p>

<h3 id="persistence-gets-you-to-the-finish-line">Persistence gets you to the finish line.</h3>
<p>Every thing in life you want to accomplish is the same. Rarely, will you get what you want the first time you ask. You must be persistent to get to what you want out of life.</p>

<p><strong>Persistence is what keeps most people from meeting their goals.</strong></p>

<p>Think about that New Year’s resolutions. You probably failed. Me too. I have failed at every New Year’s resolution I have ever set. Only because my persistence stopped the second week of January.</p>

<h3 id="i-failed-again-why">I failed again, why?</h3>
<p>Here’s my reasoning for that. I always set large goals that are extremely hard to obtain. But I never set a path to get there. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Let’s use weight loss an example. We set goal to lose a 100 pounds this year and say we will start going to the gym. We go that first week 7 times. We get sore and life happens. Before we know it, June has arrived and we haven’t seen a gym since January or lost weight.</p>

<p>We never defined how to get to the goal. We only said we would lose 100 pounds. This is where smaller (micro and macro) goals come into play.</p>

<p>Once we know our end goal. We have to set smaller goals. These smaller goals help us feel accomplished. The accomplishments are what keeps us persistent in reaching the big goal.</p>

<h3 id="smaller-goals-defined">Smaller goals defined.</h3>
<p>A micro goal would be, I am going to lose 10 pounds this month. 10 pounds sounds much easier to get to than 100. Also we have set a smaller timeline. 1 month</p>

<p>Now we have the end game and the short term. I think we need to set even smaller macro goals. The macro goal would be I’m going to the gym 2 times this week.</p>

<h3 id="lets-get-it-started-in-here">Let’s get it started in here.</h3>
<p>Now for the most important thing, schedule it and then do it. Put it on your calendar and push yourself to show up. You will be proud of yourself for just showing up. Showing up will keep you motivated.</p>

<p>The next week add another macro goal to the first macro goal you set. This could be I am going to lower my sugar intake this week. So now you’re going to the gym 2 days and watching sugar intake.</p>

<p>By setting these smaller (macro) goals, you helping yourself form habits and persistence. These habits are the foundations to reach the bigger goal.</p>

<p>Big picture goals are great. The smaller goals are what gets you to the finish line. Start setting these as soon as possible. You will notice your persistence will increase and you will start hitting your goals.</p>
