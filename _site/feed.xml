&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When dealing with change and people, you have to realize there are emotions tied to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All humans must go through certain emotions during change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important because you need to know how to deal with people during change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These apply when you are changing your life or if something happens to someone you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will have to go through these stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its easier to deal with the emotions, if you know what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 7 emotions that occur before acceptance of a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-7-stages&quot;&gt;The 7 stages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People progress through all 7 in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Shock&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Disbelief&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Self Doubt&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Acceptance&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Experimentation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Search for Meaning&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Integration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each individual may vary how long  they spend in each stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are emotions so some people are better equipped to deal with stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stage-1---shock&quot;&gt;Stage 1 - Shock&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a person is shock they will be numb to the news of the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They expect one thing but reality is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stage-2---denial&quot;&gt;Stage 2 - Denial&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second stage, people deny the changes are happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will carry on as if nothing has happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stage-3---self-doubt&quot;&gt;Stage 3 - Self Doubt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reality sets in.  Frustration begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can become angry or even depressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people you need to help see the positives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must show the most empathy towards people in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People generally spend the most time here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stage-4---acceptance&quot;&gt;Stage 4 - Acceptance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acceptance is where you want to get people quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get them here by showing great empathy and showing them the greener grass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people that get here the quickest can help the ones that are in the 1st 3 stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stage-5---experimentation&quot;&gt;Stage 5 - Experimentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People here will have a new energy and positive attitude towards the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change starts setting in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stage-6---search-for-meaning&quot;&gt;Stage 6 - Search for Meaning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the change actually becomes real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People want to know what happened and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the questions occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stage-7---integration&quot;&gt;Stage 7 - Integration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the new attitudes and behaviors become habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could also be called acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know the stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can probably see situations where you went through the stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing this is important to all coaches, trainers, and leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are more effective if you understand, what your people are going through.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="process" /><category term="improvement," /><category term="change," /><summary type="html">Photo by Alexas Fotos from Pexels When dealing with change and people, you have to realize there are emotions tied to change.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a manager that I would constantly butt heads with. He was military minded. I never seemed to have the right answer for him. I would explain to him endlessly. 
Truth be told, no one cared for him. All for the same reasons. Everyone said “He just doesn’t care to listen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-top-performer&quot;&gt;The Top Performer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time I was the top performer on our team and top 5% in our department. This is where you wanted to be in the rankings. He brought me into a meeting to let me know that I had a laundry list of things to improve on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After he was done, I was so angry with him that I really didn’t want to talk to him.  I ended up saying, “Yes sir, I’ll fix it.” The tension in the room instantly dropped on his side. I could tell I had made a stride on dealing with his unwillingness to listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;explanations-are-just-another-excuse&quot;&gt;Explanations are just another excuse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I ended up learning about him would later, help me change my life. He didn’t want excuses. He took my explaining as excuses. He didn’t care, why it happened. He only wanted assurance, the problem would be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;controlling-the-situation&quot;&gt;Controlling the situation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in life, I figured out this was called taking accountability. Taking accountability allows you to do 3 things. You stop arguments, blaming other people and control the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is being able to control your emotions. Emotions come from things, we feel, we can’t control. If you can stop the trigger of the emotions, you can move on quicker. Accountability is a sure fire way to control most of the emotions you feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-accountability-look-like&quot;&gt;What does accountability look like?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt;  My kid made bad grades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The excuse:&lt;/strong&gt; They should’ve worked harder to get a better grade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accountability:&lt;/strong&gt; I should’ve spent more time making sure they received the help they needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;heres-another-example&quot;&gt;Here’s another example.&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem:&lt;/strong&gt; My spouse doesn’t clean the house the way I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The excuse:&lt;/strong&gt; My spouse is just lazy and half way does everything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accountability:&lt;/strong&gt; I could’ve gotten up and helped to clean up the mess.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-part-of-the-problem&quot;&gt;Be part of the problem.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see a pattern? Your excuses are what someone else could’ve done. The excuse could be 100% true. With accountability, you’ve got skin in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By taking accountability, you are now part of the problem. Being part of the problem, changes excuses into something you can control. Controlling the situation, gives you a freedom to fix any problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;out-of-control&quot;&gt;Out of control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somethings in life that you can’t control. For things you can’t control, learn to let them go. Learn to say, I can’t control this. After you say, “I can’t control it.”, move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You waste so much of your time on things you can’t control. You should take this wasted time and turn it into something productive. Instead invest this new energy into learning a hobby, side venture, or complete a goal you have been putting off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn to become accountable to everything around you. Then learn to let go of things you can’t control. You will find yourself in a much better place. You will have a clear head and a ton of time for you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="accountability," /><category term="excuses" /><summary type="html">Photo by Andrea Piacquadio from Pexels I had a manager that I would constantly butt heads with.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my life, I spent my quiet time coming up with ideas. Matter of fact, I have a ton of ideas. For those that know me well, I am a very analytical person.I analyze everything around me, constantly. When you meet me, I am very quiet. I am quiet because I am analyzing everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, I hold myself back from speaking. I do this because I don’t want to say something stupid. I lack confidence in social situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-great-procrastinator&quot;&gt;The Great Procrastinator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have one other thing that I hold myself back from, action. I tend to be a procrastinator. I always meet deadlines but scramble to get them done at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend hours analyzing how to do something. I have to know everything before I can get started. I have found, what causes this procrastination for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;paralyzed&quot;&gt;Paralyzed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I feel like I know everything about a subject, then comes the what I need to get started. Here’s what those look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I need a new camera to start that YouTube channel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I need more followers to start that newsletter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can’t post this on Instagram because its not a perfect picture.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if someone doesn’t like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procrastination is not laziness. My procrastination is from fear of failure. This fear is paralyzing. Especially, for a person that lacks self confidence. I don’t want to be seen as a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comfortable-with-uncomfortable&quot;&gt;Comfortable with uncomfortable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife on the other hand is super confident. I think that confidence is what draws me to her. We are the proverbial yin and yang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She drives me to want more from life. At first, I rejected this because it wasn’t normal to just do something that wasn’t planned out. Now, I have become somewhat comfortable with being uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stuck-on-the-diving-board&quot;&gt;Stuck on the diving board&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much reflection here’s what I found. If I just start, the voices, in my head, have no influence over me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I wait until I feel ready, I never get started.  Here’s a good quote I came across from somewhere, “If you wait for the perfect temperature in the pool, you’ll always be left standing on the diving board.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have read many biographies of, who I would deem, successful people. I have found these people all have the same trait. They start without knowing the how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful people, start and learn as they go. Then, they surround themselves with people who can teach them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-road-ahead&quot;&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started to make myself do things. I’m still here. I’m not embarrassed. My failures are learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now fail in public more. You didn’t even see they happened. In the grand scheme of things, other people are not paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My self confidence is higher than ever. I’m moving forward and excited where this road will take me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you can find more confidence to start. Starting is the most important thing. Once you start, the rest falls in place. You’re not lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s 6 a.m. The alarm goes off having to be out the door in 30 minutes to make it to work by 7 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hop out of bed. Run to start some coffee. Jump in the shower. Quickly brush my teeth. Sling on some clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running out the door, I pour the coffee into a travel cup and grab my wallet and keys. Now with no time to spare, zooming down the highway at 90 just hoping there’s no traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit the floor running with only seconds between being on time and being late. Starting everyday on a negative note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably would have a better attitude, by escaping my rush after waking up. There’s got to be a better way, I reflected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have come to believe, it is as easy as setting up a routine. So far, here is what I have found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-1-prep-the-night-before&quot;&gt;Step 1. Prep the night before.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you, like me, already know what you need for the next day. There’s no reason not to have it ready the night before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the same thing you need everyday. Clothes, a drink, some form of lunch, and a shower. Everything except maybe the shower.
Thibaut @Kpaxs
Your evening routine is about taking the decisions out of your morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to wake up already knowing what you’re going to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-2-wake-up-earlier&quot;&gt;Step 2. Wake up earlier&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is logical but it leads to the 3rd step. Waking up earlier would give time to gather thoughts and plan out the day. Then find a little peace before the chaos of the day starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just make sure not to procrastinate during this extra time. You will end up back where you started. Set a reminder and stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-3-take-time-for-yourself&quot;&gt;Step 3. Take time for yourself&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I am not much of a morning person. Most people need coffee but I need isolation. I find that taking 30 minutes to start the day, I am much more productive and happy. This time gives me a chance to gather myself, my thoughts and prepare for the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-i-am-doing&quot;&gt;How I am doing.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started to slowly incorporate these things into my day. I find that the days, that I do these things, I tend to be happier and more productive. The days where I skip one of these 3 things, the day is chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can incorporate these into your routine and you will find similar results or maybe there is something you already do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="attitude," /><category term="routine," /><category term="habits," /><category term="morning" /><summary type="html">Photo by Andrew Neel from Pexels It’s 6 a.m. The alarm goes off having to be out the door in 30 minutes to make it to work by 7 a.m. I hop out of bed. Run to start some coffee. Jump in the shower. Quickly brush my teeth. Sling on some clothes. Running out the door, I pour the coffee into a travel cup and grab my wallet and keys. Now with no time to spare, zooming down the highway at 90 just hoping there’s no traffic. Sound familiar? I hit the floor running with only seconds between being on time and being late. Starting everyday on a negative note. I probably would have a better attitude, by escaping my rush after waking up. There’s got to be a better way, I reflected. I have come to believe, it is as easy as setting up a routine. So far, here is what I have found. Step 1. Prep the night before. If you, like me, already know what you need for the next day. There’s no reason not to have it ready the night before. It’s the same thing you need everyday. Clothes, a drink, some form of lunch, and a shower. Everything except maybe the shower. Thibaut @Kpaxs Your evening routine is about taking the decisions out of your morning. You want to wake up already knowing what you’re going to do. Step 2. Wake up earlier This one is logical but it leads to the 3rd step. Waking up earlier would give time to gather thoughts and plan out the day. Then find a little peace before the chaos of the day starts. Just make sure not to procrastinate during this extra time. You will end up back where you started. Set a reminder and stick to it. Step 3. Take time for yourself For me, I am not much of a morning person. Most people need coffee but I need isolation.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day my 3 year old wanted a toy from behind the couch. He kept on and on until I stopped what I was doing to get the toy. Why was he so persistent? He knew that eventually I would give in as long as he was persistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;persistence-gets-you-to-the-finish-line&quot;&gt;Persistence gets you to the finish line.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every thing in life you want to accomplish is the same. Rarely, will you get what you want the first time you ask. You must be persistent to get to what you want out of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistence is what keeps most people from meeting their goals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about that New Year’s resolutions. You probably failed. Me too. I have failed at every New Year’s resolution I have ever set. Only because my persistence stopped the second week of January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-failed-again-why&quot;&gt;I failed again, why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my reasoning for that. I always set large goals that are extremely hard to obtain. But I never set a path to get there. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s use weight loss an example. We set goal to lose a 100 pounds this year and say we will start going to the gym. We go that first week 7 times. We get sore and life happens. Before we know it, June has arrived and we haven’t seen a gym since January or lost weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We never defined how to get to the goal. We only said we would lose 100 pounds. This is where smaller (micro and macro) goals come into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we know our end goal. We have to set smaller goals. These smaller goals help us feel accomplished. The accomplishments are what keeps us persistent in reaching the big goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;smaller-goals-defined&quot;&gt;Smaller goals defined.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A micro goal would be, I am going to lose 10 pounds this month. 10 pounds sounds much easier to get to than 100. Also we have set a smaller timeline. 1 month&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have the end game and the short term. I think we need to set even smaller macro goals. The macro goal would be I’m going to the gym 2 times this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-get-it-started-in-here&quot;&gt;Let’s get it started in here.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the most important thing, schedule it and then do it. Put it on your calendar and push yourself to show up. You will be proud of yourself for just showing up. Showing up will keep you motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next week add another macro goal to the first macro goal you set. This could be I am going to lower my sugar intake this week. So now you’re going to the gym 2 days and watching sugar intake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By setting these smaller (macro) goals, you helping yourself form habits and persistence. These habits are the foundations to reach the bigger goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big picture goals are great. The smaller goals are what gets you to the finish line. Start setting these as soon as possible. You will notice your persistence will increase and you will start hitting your goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="persistence," /><category term="kids," /><category term="goals" /><summary type="html">Photo by Porapak Apichodilok from Pexels The other day my 3 year old wanted a toy from behind the couch.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I gave titles to the decades of my life, my 30’s would be, “The Decade Of Self Reflection”. In my reflection, I have found my mindset to be my biggest set back. I have consistently been my own antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-reflection&quot;&gt;My Reflection.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time and time again, I set myself up for complacency. I would talk myself out of action. I always had excuses for why I couldn’t do something. I never asked, “How can I do this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some examples. I don’t have time. I don’t understand that. I’ll look into that. Other people will think its dumb. Sound familiar? These are the phrases we tell ourselves to stay lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I made it through these excuses, the possibility of failure set in. I would not allow myself to fail. Failure was not an option. Again, another defense mechanism to keep myself lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more and more I hear stories of successful people, I realize they do 2 things. First they ask themselves, “ What can I do?” Then they fail and learn from the mistakes. They take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heres-what-happened-for-me&quot;&gt;Here’s what happened for me.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed my mindset from a statement to asking a question. Now I ask, “Why I can’t?”, instead of saying, “Why I can’t.” Notice they are the same set of words with different punctuation. Asking myself a question requires me to respond. A statement doesn’t. The statement shuts down the idea instantly. See how that works? Changing the punctuation, changes the mindset and the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This small mindset change, changed the reflection and my reaction. In reality, I could’ve always done these things, but I was just too lazy to try. I was too busy making excuses instead of being busy trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just try most things and see what happens. I have tried so many things and failed. I have started blogs, tried video game streaming, Facebook groups, Reddit communities, Instagram accounts, and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these failures, I have learned what my actual passions are and how to keep them fueled. Also, I have learned things that were unexpected such as marketing, forming communities, copy writing, and leveraging social media. I am still learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-mindset-is-your-reflection&quot;&gt;Your mindset is your reflection.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, I have learned that my mindset is the reflection I see. I am sure there is something that has been in the back of your mind that you want to accomplish. Ask yourself, “How can I do this?”. The answer that comes to mind, give it a try. I bet your reflection changes too. Before too long you will strike gold.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever heard the cliché, you are the people you surround yourself with? I know I sure have. In life, I have found by changing the people around me, I have changed the way of my life’s progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been teaching my oldest son about choosing the people around him wisely. As I said before, he is starting high school this coming fall. He is at the age where kids are generally the most impressionable by their peers. In my life, I have noticed that most people don’t keep an eye on the people around them. My belief is this is what keeps people down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-influence-of-others&quot;&gt;The influence of others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can be easily influenced. Don’t believe me, take a look around your house. How many things do you see that are a name brand, you saw on TV, or social media? I’m not here to judge you. Currently, I am sitting in Nike clothes and Nike shoes. Why? “I wanna be like Mike.” Just kidding, but that is where it started for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a psychiatrist but I am guessing it starts as soon as we are born. Humans naturally learn by watching others. We start walking and talking because we see our parents doing it. Our culture learns from those people around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These people can be broken into 3 different groups:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Friends and Family&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community (Our peer group)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Influencers (Celebrities)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why your parents have probably said to you, “If so and so jumped over a bridge, would you do it too?” Unfortunately, in some aspects of our lives the answer is yes. This can be a good thing or a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-is-the-person-in-the-mirror&quot;&gt;Who is the person in the mirror?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is up to us to determine what is good and what is bad. In terms of our topic, it is up to us to determine what to mentality and influence to keep around. The people directly around us have the most influence and luckily, we control who we spend the most time with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the hard work, self reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you see yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you negative? Are you poor? Are you unhappy? Do you lack confidence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now look at the 5 people closest to you. Do you see any similarities? Most likely you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next decide what part of you, needs to change. Let’s say you want to be more positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now find at least one person in your peer group, who seems to be always positive. Start hanging with this person more than one other person in your group of 5. Now you need to spend less time with the most negative person in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-beginning-of-change&quot;&gt;The Beginning of Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letting someone go doesn’t mean you hate them, it just means you need better influence in your life. This doesn’t have to be permanent. You need someone with a different focus right now. You don’t have to stop talking to them. You might just need to stop talking to them so frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has that one negative person, let’s call them Negative Nancy (sorry Nancy it works for this example and you’re probably a really nice lady). When you talk to her, you find yourself hearing all the bad things in her world. Ultimately, you walk away feeling worse. To help you become more positive, you have to change the frequency of contact with Negative Nancy. This helps you stay positive more of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies to many other aspects of life. Continue to evaluate the closest 5 people to you. Want to be successful or work out more? Find a successful person or person that constantly works out. Start to hang out with these people more. You will slowly start to see your focus change. You will become more like the people you choose to be around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have done this subconsciously and consciously throughout my life (even accidentally). Every time, I have started to change those around me, I have major changes in my life. Emotionally it’s hard to do and takes a lot of self reflection and self awareness to complete.  In the end, you have to love yourself before you can love others. This is one small step to becoming a better you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="mindset," /><category term="inner" /><category term="circle," /><category term="self" /><category term="reflection" /><summary type="html">Photo by Joseph Wayne Buchanan from Pexels Ever heard the cliché, you are the people you surround yourself with?

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-made-it-where-do-i-go-now&quot;&gt;I Made It, Where Do I Go Now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we dig into the second thing all successful people do. Last week we walked through showing up. Once you’re in attendance there is one more step to success. Paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are present, you need to have presence. Once you start showing up everyday and have awareness of what is happening, the rest will fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-change&quot;&gt;The Change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my sons has started to play baseball. He has been on the fence if he really likes it. It is hard for him to focus during practice. We have really been working to help him pay attention during practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With very little practice at home, he has began to progress. He has worked himself from outfield to infield. He is starting to like baseball more and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has changed in him? He became more teachable just by paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is excited about getting better. Also, he is seeing his own progress and how to improve more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-teachable&quot;&gt;Be Teachable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we show up and pay attention, we become more teachable. Being more teachable helps us learn easier. This learning gets us where we want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tons of people that want to help you. These people are looking out out for new people to mentor. If you aren’t looking for them, you’ll never notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coaches are looking for people who pay the most attention. They want to work with the most coachable people. Otherwise it would be a waste of their time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my son’s case, he started paying more attention at practice. One of the coaches took him under his wing and started working with him more. This extra help has taken him from one of the worst to one of the better players. This happened in a matter of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-actually-happens&quot;&gt;What Actually Happens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one example shows if we show up and pay attention, good things will start to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our mindset changes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our engagement increases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our opportunities increase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same thing applies to everyone and every age. As we become more coachable, our skills will increase. In return, we become more valuable to the people around us. Then the opportunities will start to come our way. These opportunities are the foundational steps to our success.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="mindset," /><category term="presence" /><summary type="html">Photo by Pixabay from Pexels I Made It, Where Do I Go Now? This week we dig into the second thing all successful people do. Last week we walked through showing up. Once you’re in attendance there is one more step to success. Paying attention. Once you are present, you need to have presence. Once you start showing up everyday and have awareness of what is happening, the rest will fall into place. The Change One of my sons has started to play baseball. He has been on the fence if he really likes it. It is hard for him to focus during practice. We have really been working to help him pay attention during practice. With very little practice at home, he has began to progress. He has worked himself from outfield to infield. He is starting to like baseball more and more. What has changed in him? He became more teachable just by paying attention. He is excited about getting better. Also, he is seeing his own progress and how to improve more. Be Teachable I believe we show up and pay attention, we become more teachable. Being more teachable helps us learn easier. This learning gets us where we want to be. There are tons of people that want to help you. These people are looking out out for new people to mentor. If you aren’t looking for them, you’ll never notice. Coaches are looking for people who pay the most attention. They want to work with the most coachable people. Otherwise it would be a waste of their time. In my son’s case, he started paying more attention at practice. One of the coaches took him under his wing and started working with him more. This extra help has taken him from one of the worst to one of the better players. This happened in a matter of weeks. What Actually Happens This one example shows if we show up and pay attention, good things will start to happen. Our mindset changes Our engagement increases Our opportunities increase The same thing applies to everyone and every age. As we become more coachable, our skills will increase. In return, we become more valuable to the people around us. Then the opportunities will start to come our way. These opportunities are the foundational steps to our success.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Success in Life.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-backstory&quot;&gt;Some Backstory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may not know my back story, so let me share. I am a Dad to 4 great boys with a girl on the way. We spend a ton of time teaching life lessons. Our oldest son is 15 and starting high school this year. We have been trying to help him understand this year starts real life. Our next eldest son is 11 and we are working on accountability for your actions. Our 6 year old, has been learning how to be a good teammate as he starts his first season of baseball. Last but not least, our youngest is 3 and learning manners. Around my house, two topics keep popping up and I feel everyone would benefit from a refresher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;showing-up&quot;&gt;SHOWING UP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize as I get older, two things are more important than anything else. I believe, wholeheartedly, if you show up and pay attention you will be ahead of 90% of people. Showing up and paying attention are building blocks for trust in all types of relationships. Luckily, both characteristics are controlled by you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows a person, who says, “I’ll be there.”, then you don’t hear from them until weeks later. You actually make other plans, ahead of time, because you don’t trust they will show up. In life, you don’t want to be known as this person. Nobody trusts this person because they can’t be counted on when they are truly needed. You don’t want to be seen as this person or your chance will never happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never really understand the affect not showing up can have on other people. I was reminded by a friend, just this past weekend, of people not showing up for his birthday but my taking the time to be there. 5 years later he is still thankful for me just being present for him. This was a huge deal for him and for me I was just doing what I agreed to. As the old saying goes, people will never forget how you made them feel. Just showing up can make a huge impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swing-and-a-miss&quot;&gt;Swing and a Miss!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is basically a bunch of at bats. You can’t swing if you’re not in the stadium and you lose by default. The more you show up the more chances you have to succeed. Each time you show up, you are one step closer to success. Gen. George S. Patton said “Opportunities do not come to those who wait. They are captured by those who attack.” This could’ve easily have said, “Opportunities do not come to those who wait. They are captured by those who show up.” and still had the exact same meaning. Basically, show up and seize your chance swing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-such-thing-as-an-overnight-success&quot;&gt;No such thing as an overnight success.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You hear of overnight successes but rarely do you hear of the years of blood, sweat and tears they put in to being an “overnight success.” They show up for every opportunity until their day comes. These people are present at the right moment, so they are able to seize the moment and take the prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love reading and listening to successful entrepreneurs, celebrities, and other people’s climb to the top. I have found that there is always one common thing they share, showing up. Last week I wrote about Michael Jordan and his responding to failure. Did you know he didn’t make his high school team the first year he tried out? What was his response? He showed up the next year and made the team and changed the basketball landscape forever. What would basketball be like if Mike had sat at home because he didn’t make it the first time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good example is Bobby Bones, who is a national radio show host and mentor on American Idol. Bobby knew he wanted to be in radio, so he started in high school. He was a janitor for a local radio station. Everyday, he showed up and took advantage of the small opportunities to learn about radio. One day, the station’s normal DJ didn’t show up and he got his shot. Years later, he has one of the most listened to shows in the country. Obviously, the end success was still more hard work but the point is Bobby Bones wouldn’t be who he is today if he didn’t do the most simple thing, show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are countless other people, I could list. Basically, go find a CEO, musician, celebrity, athlete or other successful person and read their story. You will see a story of how one day they showed up and everything aligned. There is no luck in life, just showing up for your moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, you have to make the most of the time you have. Time is the one thing that we can’t get back. The more time you waste, the less you can achieve. If you’re not showing up, then all you are doing is wasting your time and probably other people’s time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="success," /><category term="life," /><category term="accountability" /><summary type="html">Photo by Dark Indigo from Pexels Some Backstory Some of you may not know my back story, so let me share.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family and I finished The Last Dance documentary this week and for me it was so good. (No spoilers) It was nice to relive my childhood and see some of the great plays that they made. The sound of their intro music still gets me pumped. But there was so much more to the documentary other than the happenings on the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deep dive into Jordan’s personality is what stood out most to me. He is a winner and wanted to win at all cost. This is what made him a champion, but his flaws are what made him great. Never once did I see Jordan blame anyone else for the shortcomings. Instead he learned from the losses and came back better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan is not the greatest because of the rings or the MVPs he earned. He is the greatest because of how he bounced back from the losses. His goal was to always improve and he did. That’s why he is the greatest of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the take away from this documentary is never let defeat bring you down; instead, take the defeat and use it to motivate you to be better. It’s cliche but practice makes perfect and no one practiced more than Jordan. Defeat for him was only temporary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people can take defeat hard, including me. I can hang on the negatives for too long and let them get into my head. Instead we should push through the negatives, take accountability and just move on. Sitting on the negatives doesn’t get anything done. Instead we should strive to fix those things that we can and let everything else go. This is something I have been working on for a while and has brought major improvements to my quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this documentary can be a lesson for someone out there that is struggling to get back up from defeat. Take your defeat with pride and come back stronger. Defeat is only temporary but how you bounce back is what defines you. Let’s go into this long weekend with a new attitude and “Be Like Mike.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Photo by Markus Spiske from Pexels My family and I finished The Last Dance documentary this week and for me it was so good.
