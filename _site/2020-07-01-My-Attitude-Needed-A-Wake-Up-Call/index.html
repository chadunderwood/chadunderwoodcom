<p>It’s 6 a.m. The alarm goes off having to be out the door in 30 minutes to make it to work by 7 a.m.</p>

<p>I hop out of bed. Run to start some coffee. Jump in the shower. Quickly brush my teeth. Sling on some clothes.</p>

<p>Running out the door, I pour the coffee into a travel cup and grab my wallet and keys. Now with no time to spare, zooming down the highway at 90 just hoping there’s no traffic.</p>

<p>Sound familiar? </p>

<p>I hit the floor running with only seconds between being on time and being late. Starting everyday on a negative note.</p>

<p>I probably would have a better attitude, by escaping my rush after waking up. There’s got to be a better way, I reflected.</p>

<p>I have come to believe, it is as easy as setting up a routine. So far, here is what I have found.</p>

<p>Step 1. Prep the night before.</p>

<p>If you, like me, already know what you need for the next day. There’s no reason not to have it ready the night before.</p>

<p>It’s the same thing you need everyday. Clothes, a drink, some form of lunch, and a shower. Everything except maybe the shower.</p>

<p>Step 2. Wake up earlier</p>

<p>This one is logical but it leads to the 3rd step. Waking up earlier would give time to gather thoughts and plan out the day. Then find a little peace before the chaos of the day starts.</p>

<p>Just make sure not to procrastinate during this extra time. You will end up back where you started. Set a reminder and stick to it.</p>

<p>Step 3. Take time for yourself</p>

<p>For me, I am not much of a morning person. Most people need coffee but I need isolation. I find that taking 30 minutes to start the day, I am much more productive and happy. This time gives me a chance to gather myself, my thoughts and prepare for the day ahead.</p>

<p>How I am doing.</p>

<p>I have started to slowly incorporate these things into my day. I find that the days, that I do these things, I tend to be happier and more productive. The days where I skip one of these 3 things, the day is chaotic.</p>

<p>Maybe you can incorporate these into your routine and you will find similar results or maybe there is something you already do.</p>

Your evening routine is about taking the decisions out of your morning.</p>

<p>You want to wake up already knowing what you’re going to do.</p>
