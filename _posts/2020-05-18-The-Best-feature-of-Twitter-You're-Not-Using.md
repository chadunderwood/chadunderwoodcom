For years, I have sang the praises of Twitter. In my opinion, Twitter is the most powerful social network of all the land. It lends the best layout for conversation and networking with people you don't know. The others are greared toward friends or people you know. They all have great features but for my money, Twitter is champion. 

### One Downside
As the site has grown, so have the issues. For one, the users of Twitter became very political. Politics are fine and in my opinion everyone should be able to share their thoughts any where they want. However, that doesn't mean I actually want to hear them. There was a point all you would see and hear were people's political opinions. It was so much for me in fact, I had to take a break from Twitter. I have seen others that have done the same. Twitter's openness can also lead to burn out from an end user perspective. 

At some point, during my hiatus, Twitter released an option to mute words. (From a quick search it looks like this released in 2016) This is the best feature that no other social network (to my knowledge) has caught on to. The ability to block keywords, or mute phrases brought me back to the network. It is a very simple featureand I have been a happy user since they implemented it and I was able to get mine setup. 

You were able to block people for a long time. There are times when you don't want to block someone because they may talk about other things you like to keep up with. This is where the mute words feature shines. Now you don't have to see topics that you don't care about and you can still follow anyone. It took a little while for me to get the right collection, but I have been able to configure Twitter to my liking. I no longer have to hear anybody's political commentary or have my favorite shows and sporting events spoiled. Feature for feature this is the best setting of all of the social networks.

If you are looking for the feature, head over to Settings>Privacy and Safety>Muted>Muted Words. You can get in here and start adding words, hashtags, or phrases. This setting as of 05/15/20 only seems to mute words in your main timeline. Maybe one day we will see a mute for the whole site. Then you can choose how long you want to mute the word or phrase and if you want to mute it from everyone or just people you don't follow. After this you shouldn't longer see the word/phrase
