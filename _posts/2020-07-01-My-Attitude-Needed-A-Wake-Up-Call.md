### 3 Ideas To A Better Morning routine.

It's 6 a.m. The alarm goes off having to be out the door in 30 minutes to make it to work by 7 a.m.

I hop out of bed. Run to start some coffee. Jump in the shower. Quickly brush my teeth. Sling on some clothes.

Running out the door, I pour the coffee into a travel cup and grab my wallet and keys. Now with no time to spare, zooming down the highway at 90 just hoping there’s no traffic.

Sound familiar? <!--more-->




I hit the floor running with only seconds between being on time and being late. Starting everyday on a negative note.

I probably would have a better attitude, by escaping my rush after waking up. There's got to be a better way, I reflected.

I have come to believe, it is as easy as setting up a routine. So far, here is what I have found.

#### Step 1. Prep the night before.  

If you, like me, already know what you need for the next day. There's no reason not to have it ready the night before.

It’s the same thing you need everyday. Clothes, a drink, some form of lunch, and a shower. Everything except maybe the shower.

Your evening routine is about taking the decisions out of your morning.

You want to wake up already knowing what you’re going to do.



#### Step 2. Wake up earlier

This one is logical but it leads to the 3rd step. Waking up earlier would give time to gather thoughts and plan out the day. Then find a little peace before the chaos of the day starts.

Just make sure not to procrastinate during this extra time. You will end up back where you started. Set a reminder and stick to it.

#### Step 3. Take time for yourself

For me, I am not much of a morning person. Most people need coffee but I need isolation. I find that taking 30 minutes to start the day, I am much more productive and happy. This time gives me a chance to gather myself, my thoughts and prepare for the day ahead.

### How I am doing.

I have started to slowly incorporate these things into my day. I find that the days, that I do these things, I tend to be happier and more productive. The days where I skip one of these 3 things, the day is chaotic.

Maybe you can incorporate these into your routine and you will find similar results or maybe there is something you already do.
