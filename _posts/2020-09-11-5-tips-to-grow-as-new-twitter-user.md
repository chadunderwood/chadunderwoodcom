<p>You signed up for a Twitter account.</p>
<p>Then you followed some great people.</p>
<p>What do you do now? Great that you ask.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Pick 2-3 Topics to Tweet About</strong><br>
Before you start tweeting, you should know your topics you will tweet about.</p>
<p>This will be your niche. You niche will set you apart.</p>
<p>Your first topic should be something you can talk about for 30 minutes without stopping.</p>
<p>The 2nd and 3rd topics are not as important.</p>
<p>But they should compliment the 1st one.</p>
<p>Too many topics and people are less likely to follow you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add value to larger accounts</strong><br>
Engaging with others posts is where things will start to flow.</p>
<p>This helps other users see your profile.</p>
<p>Other users will start seeing your comments.</p>
<p>Then eventually follow you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post 3 times daily</strong><br>
It is necessary to post daily before growth will start.</p>
<p>When someone comes to your profile, they need to see what you are about.</p>
<p>3 posts per day is all you need. Remember to stay on topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retweet 5-10 times per day</strong><br>
Retweets add content to your page you didn’t come up with.</p>
<p>They allow you to push more value to your followers.</p>
<p>A good amount is 5 - 10 daily. Make sure they are spread out.</p>
<p>You don’t want to push to many tweets at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quote Tweet 3 times per day</strong><br>
Quote tweets are another great way to have content with little thought.</p>
<p>All you have to do is retweet and then add you spin to the post.</p>
<p>This can be an extension of their thought.</p>
<p>Or a differing opinion. Completely up to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bonus Tip: Schedule Tweets</strong><br>
Since, I like you. I’m adding another tip.</p>
<p>Scheduling tweets is the best way post 3 tweets daily.</p>
<p>Some days you’ll have a ton of ideas.</p>
<p>Some you won’t. For the days you don’t scheduling will save you.</p>
<p>There are tools to help schedule.</p>
<p>Twitter has one built in.</p>
<p>And there is one called Tweetdeck.</p>
<p>Personally I use (affilliate link) <a href="https://hypefury.com/?via=chadaunderwood">Hypefury</a>.</p>

</ol>
