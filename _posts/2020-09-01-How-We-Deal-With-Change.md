When dealing with change and people, you have to realize there are emotions tied to change.

All humans must go through certain emotions during change.

This is important because you need to know how to deal with people during change.

These apply when you are changing your life or if something happens to someone you know.

They will have to go through these stages.

Its easier to deal with the emotions, if you know what to expect.

Let's get started.

There are 7 emotions that occur before acceptance of a change.

## The 7 stages
People progress through all 7 in order.
> 1. Shock
> 2. Disbelief
> 3. Self Doubt
> 4. Acceptance
> 5. Experimentation
> 6. Search for Meaning
> 7. Integration

Each individual may vary how long  they spend in each stage.

These are emotions so some people are better equipped to deal with stressful situations.

## Stage 1 - Shock

When a person is shock they will be numb to the news of the change.

They expect one thing but reality is different.

## Stage 2 - Denial

In the second stage, people deny the changes are happening.

They will carry on as if nothing has happened.

## Stage 3 - Self Doubt

Reality sets in.  Frustration begins.

People can become angry or even depressed.

These people you need to help see the positives.

You must show the most empathy towards people in doubt.

People generally spend the most time here.

## Stage 4 - Acceptance

Acceptance is where you want to get people quickly.

You get them here by showing great empathy and showing them the greener grass.

The people that get here the quickest can help the ones that are in the 1st 3 stages.

## Stage 5 - Experimentation

People here will have a new energy and positive attitude towards the change.

The change starts setting in.

## Stage 6 - Search for Meaning

This is where the change actually becomes real.

People want to know what happened and why.

This is where the questions occur.

## Stage 7 - Integration

This is where the new attitudes and behaviors become habits.

This could also be called acceptance.

Now that you know the stages.

You can probably see situations where you went through the stages.

Knowing this is important to all coaches, trainers, and leaders.

You are more effective if you understand, what your people are going through.
