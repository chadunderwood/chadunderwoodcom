There are rules to the Twitter community. There is [things you can do to grow.](https://chadunderwood.com/article/5-tips-to-grow-as-new-twitter-user/) Also, there are things you can do to decline. After reading this you have no excuses to decline. Consider this your warning. You will end up blocked by most accounts.

All of these individually, are enough for you to lose your following. All of that hard work will be gone. And it will be gone overnight.

1. **Don't ask for follow backs**
	When you are a smaller it seems hard to grow. You are willing to do 	anything to get a follow. Including, getting in the DMs and asking for follows. Larger accounts see these all the time. The larger accounts will not be empathetic to your situation. Most likely, they will just block you. 

	Access to their tweets is more important than having them as a follower. One retweet from a large account can amass many followers. If you are on their radar enough they will follow you on their own. 

	The better play is to quote tweet their tweets. They get a notification you are adding value to their tweet and you are helping spread their name. Its a win win. You give more to your followers and you are noticed by the larger account. Keep getting their attention and they will follow you.

2. **Don't promote on other people's tweet**
	Promotion on other's tweets is another huge no no. Selling is something that has to be done correctly. Spamming everywhere just doesn't work. 

	Most accounts are working a plan to push an offer to their followers. You dropping a link in their comments, is throwing that plan off. Its the equivalent of walking into a grocery store and trying to sell someone your milk brand. The store would kick you out instantly and the Twitter account will block you.
	
3. **Don't expect immediate responses in DMs**
	One of the greatest things about the openness of Twitter is the direct messages. You can directly contact with much larger accounts. Most large accounts are willing to share help and advice. This advice and help can be invaluable. Think about this before pressing for a response.
	
	Most small accounts fail to think about the person behind the large account. If they have 10,000 followers, they probably have a lot of unanswered DMs. Of the bigger accounts I know, they all try to respond to all DMs. Just realize it takes a lot of time. Pressing for a response, will stop you from getting a response and land you on the blocked list. 
	
4. **Don't follow then unfollow**
	Follow then unfollow is done by sleazy accounts. They follow as many accounts as possible hoping the person will follow them back. This method can help you get more followers. However, there is a huge drawback. 

	This type of following will not help you. You need a following that will  reply and engage on your posts. Accounts who follow everyone aren't engaged. If you only want a number, this way might work for you. If you are looking to make money, this method will never get followers that pay. Brands don't invest in accounts with no engagement. Larger accounts seeing follow then unfollow will block you.

5. **Don't post quotes without the source**
	Posting quotes is no big deal. You must make sure you are listing your source. People are happy that you shared a good quote. They don't care if you wrote it or not. There could be value for them just by knowing where the quote came from. 
	
	Posting quotes without your source is considered piracy. You will be publicly called out. Once publicly outed, you can guarantee you will be blocked. People don't like thieves and don't want to be associated with thieves. You will watch your follower account drop.
	
6. **Bonus Tip** - **Don't engage with trolls**
	This one is for your own sanity. If you find yourself engaging a troll, you will end up frustrated and angry. Trolls will do anything to make you unhappy. Their only goal is for you to publicly lose your temper. It is best to just block them and forget they exist. 

Ending up blocked by a bunch of accounts will make growth impossible. Don't get caught in these traps. Instead follow these tips, you won't have any problems on Twitter.
