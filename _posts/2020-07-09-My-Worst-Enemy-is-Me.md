### Small changes for the better.  
Most of my life, I spent my quiet time coming up with ideas. Matter of fact, I have a ton of ideas. For those that know me well, I am a very analytical person.I analyze everything around me, constantly. When you meet me, I am very quiet. I am quiet because I am analyzing everything.

Truth be told, I hold myself back from speaking. I do this because I don't want to say something stupid. I lack confidence in social situations.<!--more-->

### The Great Procrastinator

I have one other thing that I hold myself back from, action. I tend to be a procrastinator. I always meet deadlines but scramble to get them done at the last minute.

I spend hours analyzing how to do something. I have to know everything before I can get started. I have found, what causes this procrastination for me.

### Paralyzed  

Once I feel like I know everything about a subject, then comes the what I need to get started. Here’s what those look like.
     
- I need a new camera to start that YouTube channel.

- I need more followers to start that newsletter.

- I can't post this on Instagram because its not a perfect picture.

- What if someone doesn't like it.

The procrastination is not laziness. My procrastination is from fear of failure. This fear is paralyzing. Especially, for a person that lacks self confidence. I don't want to be seen as a failure.  

### Comfortable with uncomfortable  

My wife on the other hand is super confident. I think that confidence is what draws me to her. We are the proverbial yin and yang.

She drives me to want more from life. At first, I rejected this because it wasn't normal to just do something that wasn't planned out. Now, I have become somewhat comfortable with being uncomfortable.  

### Stuck on the diving board  

After much reflection here’s what I found. If I just start, the voices, in my head, have no influence over me.

If I wait until I feel ready, I never get started.  Here's a good quote I came across from somewhere, "If you wait for the perfect temperature in the pool, you'll always be left standing on the diving board."

I have read many biographies of, who I would deem, successful people. I have found these people all have the same trait. They start without knowing the how.

Successful people, start and learn as they go. Then, they surround themselves with people who can teach them.  

### The Road Ahead  

I have started to make myself do things. I’m still here. I’m not embarrassed. My failures are learning experiences.

I now fail in public more. You didn't even see they happened. In the grand scheme of things, other people are not paying attention.

My self confidence is higher than ever. I’m moving forward and excited where this road will take me.

I hope you can find more confidence to start. Starting is the most important thing. Once you start, the rest falls in place. You’re not lazy.
