### I Made It, Where Do I Go Now?
This week we dig into the second thing all successful people do. Last week we walked through showing up. Once you’re in attendance there is one more step to success. Paying attention.

Once you are present, you need to have presence. Once you start showing up everyday and have awareness of what is happening, the rest will fall into place.

### The Change
One of my sons has started to play baseball. He has been on the fence if he really likes it. It is hard for him to focus during practice. We have really been working to help him pay attention during practice.

With very little practice at home, he has began to progress. He has worked himself from outfield to infield. He is starting to like baseball more and more.

What has changed in him? He became more teachable just by paying attention.

He is excited about getting better. Also, he is seeing his own progress and how to improve more.

### Be Teachable
I believe we show up and pay attention, we become more teachable. Being more teachable helps us learn easier. This learning gets us where we want to be.

There are tons of people that want to help you. These people are looking out out for new people to mentor. If you aren't looking for them, you'll never notice.

Coaches are looking for people who pay the most attention. They want to work with the most coachable people. Otherwise it would be a waste of their time.

In my son's case, he started paying more attention at practice. One of the coaches took him under his wing and started working with him more. This extra help has taken him from one of the worst to one of the better players. This happened in a matter of weeks.

### What Actually Happens
This one example shows if we show up and pay attention, good things will start to happen.

  - Our mindset changes
  - Our engagement increases
  - Our opportunities increase

The same thing applies to everyone and every age. As we become more coachable, our skills will increase. In return, we become more valuable to the people around us. Then the opportunities will start to come our way. These opportunities are the foundational steps to our success.
