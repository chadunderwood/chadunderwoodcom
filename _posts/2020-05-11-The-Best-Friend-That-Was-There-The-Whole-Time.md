### Search Engines
Over my years in tech, I’ve always said "Search engines are your best friend for learning new things." This has always held true but I’ve started hanging with a new pal. <!--more--> In the past six months, I have found myself turning to YouTube for answers. In the past, the search engine was king for everything. However, I have had to quit being old school and move to today. I always knew YouTube was there but I was a habitual search engine user so that is where I would always turn first.

### Bring on YouTube
YouTube is best tool for learning. Truth be known I am an audible learner. YouTube not only helps with my learning style but I can find someone who explains things in a way that I can understand best. Then add in the visuals with the audio and there is no better tool for finding exactly what you need help with.

YouTube has become such a mature platform, that you can look up any topic and find anything you need or want to learn. I have yet to find any subject that I can't a how-to or a review for. If you are and DIY'er or just don't want to pay someone, YouTube should be your go to. There are how-to's for everything. In the past few months I’ve learned; yard maintenance, flower bed building, automated watering systems, photography, video editing and fixing my lawn mower. The world of learning new things is at your beckoned call but you have to remember it’s actually a resource. I have started remembering to check YouTube before anything else. Just by using YouTube as a resource, I have saved myself a ton of time and money.

I always thought of YouTube as a place for entertainment only. Over the past few months, I have found it to be way more than that. I have turned to YouTube countless times for more than just entertainment. Maybe, I am the only one but my hope is that after reading this, one person more will find themselves checking YouTube first.
