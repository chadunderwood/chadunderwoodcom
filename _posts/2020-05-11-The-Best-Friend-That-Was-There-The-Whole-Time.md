Over my years in tech, I’ve always said "Search engines are your best friend for learning new things." This has always held true. I’ve started hanging with a new pal. <!--more--> 
I have found myself turning to YouTube for answers. In the past, search engines were king for everything. I have quit being old school and move to today. 

I always knew there was a better place. But I habitually used web crawlers like Google. 

### Bring on YouTube
YouTube is best tool for learning. I am an audible learner. YouTube helps with my learning style. I can find someone who explains things in ways I understand best. Add visuals to the audio and there is no better tool. 

YouTube has become a mature platform. You can find up any topic, you need or want to learn. There is no topic, I can't find a how-to or a review for. 

Are you a DIY'er or just don't want to pay someone? YouTube should be your go to. 

**In the past few months I’ve learned:**
- yard maintenance
- flower bed building 
- automated watering systems 
- photography
- video editing 
- lawn mower repair

The world of learning new things is at your beckoned call. You only have to remember YouTube is another resource. I have started to check YouTube before anything else. Using YouTube has saved my family a ton of time and money.

I always saw YouTube as a place for entertainment. I have found it to be way more than that. Lately, I have used YouTube countless times for more than just a laugh. Maybe, I am the only one. If not, I hope you will find yourself checking YouTube first.
