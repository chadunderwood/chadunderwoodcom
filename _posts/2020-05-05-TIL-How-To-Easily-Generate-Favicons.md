Easy to generate Favicons for everything at once. I came across this website [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). This allowed me to take my logo and upload it and then it did the lifting. I was prompted for some choices on how I wanted things to look. Next all I needed to do was click submit. Then I could download the results, which included a zip file of icons and the code to be input into the head of my site.
