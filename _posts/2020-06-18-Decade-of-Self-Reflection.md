If I gave titles to the decades of my life, my 30's would be, "The Decade Of Self Reflection". In my reflection, I have found my mindset to be my biggest set back. I have consistently been my own antagonist.

### My Reflection.
Time and time again, I set myself up for complacency. I would talk myself out of action. I always had excuses for why I couldn't do something. I never asked, "How can I do this?"

Here's some examples. I don't have time. I don't understand that. I'll look into that. Other people will think its dumb. Sound familiar? These are the phrases we tell ourselves to stay lazy.

If I made it through these excuses, the possibility of failure set in. I would not allow myself to fail. Failure was not an option. Again, another defense mechanism to keep myself lazy.

The more and more I hear stories of successful people, I realize they do 2 things. First they ask themselves, " What can I do?" Then they fail and learn from the mistakes. They take action.

### Here's what happened for me.
I changed my mindset from a statement to asking a question. Now I ask, "Why I can't?", instead of saying, "Why I can't." Notice they are the same set of words with different punctuation. Asking myself a question requires me to respond. A statement doesn't. The statement shuts down the idea instantly. See how that works? Changing the punctuation, changes the mindset and the reaction.

This small mindset change, changed the reflection and my reaction. In reality, I could've always done these things, but I was just too lazy to try. I was too busy making excuses instead of being busy trying.

Now I just try most things and see what happens. I have tried so many things and failed. I have started blogs, tried video game streaming, Facebook groups, Reddit communities, Instagram accounts, and businesses.

From these failures, I have learned what my actual passions are and how to keep them fueled. Also, I have learned things that were unexpected such as marketing, forming communities, copy writing, and leveraging social media. I am still learning.

### Your mindset is your reflection.
Most importantly, I have learned that my mindset is the reflection I see. I am sure there is something that has been in the back of your mind that you want to accomplish. Ask yourself, "How can I do this?". The answer that comes to mind, give it a try. I bet your reflection changes too. Before too long you will strike gold. I believe in you!
