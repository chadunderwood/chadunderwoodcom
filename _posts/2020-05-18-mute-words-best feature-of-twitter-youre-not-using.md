The users of Twitter are very political. 
Politics are fine. Everyone should be able to share their thoughts.
That doesn't mean you want to hear them.

Twitter was build for openness.
Twitter's openness can lead to burn out.
The openness amplifies opinions.

Twitter released an option to mute words.
The best feature of Twitter.
Most don't know it exists.
No other social network (to my knowledge) has caught on to this option. The ability to mute phrases brought me back. 
It's a very simple feature.

You've been able to block people for a long time.
But you don't always want to block someone.
They may post about other things you want to keep up with.

This is where the mute words feature shines. 
You can still follow anyone.
But you don't have to see topics, you don't care about.
Get the right collection, and you no longer have to hear anybody's political commentary, or have your favorite shows and sporting events spoiled. This is the best setting of all of the social networks.

**Want to set it up?** 
Head to Settings>Privacy and Safety>Muted>Muted Words. 
Start adding words, hashtags, or phrases. 
Next you choose how long to mute the word or phrase.
You can mute the keywords for everyone or just people you don't follow. After this you shouldn't see the word/phrase anymore. 
As of 05/15/20 mute words only works for your main timeline. 
Maybe one day you will be able to mute for the whole site.

Make this change and you will find your enjoyment of Twitter increase. It's really this simple.
