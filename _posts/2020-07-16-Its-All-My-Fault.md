** ### The art of accountability**
I had a manager that I would constantly butt heads with. He was military minded. I never seemed to have the right answer for him. I would explain to him endlessly. 

Truth be told, no one cared for him. All for the same reasons. Everyone said "He just doesn't care to listen." <!--more-->

** ### The Top Performer**
At the time I was the top performer on our team and top 5% in our department. This is where you wanted to be in the rankings. He brought me into a meeting to let me know that I had a laundry list of things to improve on. 

After he was done, I was so angry with him that I really didn't want to talk to him.  I ended up saying, "Yes sir, I'll fix it." The tension in the room instantly dropped on his side. I could tell I had made a stride on dealing with his unwillingness to listen.

### Explanations are just another excuse
What I ended up learning about him would later, help me change my life. He didn't want excuses. He took my explaining as excuses. He didn't care, why it happened. He only wanted assurance, the problem would be fixed. 

### Controlling the situation
Later in life, I figured out this was called taking accountability. Taking accountability allows you to do 3 things. You stop arguments, blaming other people and control the situation.

The result is being able to control your emotions. Emotions come from things, we feel, we can't control. If you can stop the trigger of the emotions, you can move on quicker. Accountability is a sure fire way to control most of the emotions you feel. 

### What does accountability look like?
>**The problem:**  My kid made bad grades.

>**The excuse:** They should've worked harder to get a better grade.
>
>**Accountability:** I should've spent more time making sure they received the help they needed.

>
>**The problem:** My spouse doesn't clean the house the way I like it.
>
>**The excuse:** My spouse is just lazy and half way does everything.
>
>**Accountability:** I could've gotten up and helped to clean up the mess. 

### Be part of the problem.
Do you see a pattern? Your excuses are what someone else could've done. The excuse could be 100% true. With accountability, you've got skin in the game. 

By taking accountability, you are now part of the problem. Being part of the problem, changes excuses into something you can control. Controlling the situation, gives you a freedom to fix any problem. 

### Out of control
Somethings in life that you can't control. For things you can't control, learn to let them go. Learn to say, I can't control this. After you say, “I can't control it.”, move on. 

You waste so much of your time on things you can't control. You should take this wasted time and turn it into something productive. Instead invest this new energy into learning a hobby, side venture, or complete a goal you have been putting off.

Learn to become accountable to everything around you. Then learn to let go of things you can't control. You will find yourself in a much better place. You will have a clear head and a ton of time for you.
