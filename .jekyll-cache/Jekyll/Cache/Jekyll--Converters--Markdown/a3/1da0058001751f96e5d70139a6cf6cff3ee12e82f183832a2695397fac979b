I"Ä<p>This journey started in High School. I knew I was going to work in the technology field. It was the one passion I have always had, and specifically it was going to be in computers. I had taken every single computer class I could take while in school. Then came Advanced MIS. My final assignment was that I had to build an application in VB (Visual basic for you young cats). I decided that I was going to make a black jack game. It seemed like it would use everything that we had learned in the class that year. We had 6 weeks to get it working. On the last day of the class, Chadâ€™s version of Black Jack didnâ€™t work. It was on that day, I knew I was off on coding and I would never try again.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have seen people post their personal portfolio websites and I knew I wanted one. I want my own place where I own my data. One where I control everything. The truth is I have had an idea of what I wanted my site to look like but have never been able to find a theme that would fit all details. So I decided to start my journey into coding.</p>

<p>In 2017, I found freecodecamp.org. Their site make the process of learning the basics of HTML and CSS easy. They set you up with learning bits and pieces at a time and it was easy for me. I was on the track to learning as quickly and as much as I could. Amazingly, one of the projects there is to create a personal portfolio site. I  was able to complete almost all of the content they were offering for a Front-End developer certificate. Then I was distracted by the blessing of a new child and life. So off the track I went.</p>

<p>Fast forward, to this year (2020), we are once again expecting a new child. My wife has decided to go back to school and I need something to fill my extra time. So now I am back on track and motivated more than ever. What has made this time different than the others? I  found a great community on Twitter that motivates me. They are mostly experienced developers preaching the gospel of development. By preaching I mean, they let newer developers know the truth about development.</p>

<p>The truth is something that I already knew about tech but failed to realize it about development. I always just assumed every developer knew everything, about a language, before they started really doing development. Personally, I have been in the tech field for 13 years and I got my start by Googling everything. Now that I am more seasoned, I donâ€™t have to Google too much. However, I found that a lot of them are just Googlers with experience; just like me. This made learning to code seem easier and obtainable.</p>

<p>Over these months, I have been working to learn off and on. The difference for me, this time, has been knowing that I just need to be steady and learn when I can. The fact , I realize, I donâ€™t have to know everything just put me at ease. Cramming has never been my strong suit because I tend to burn out (and I have found that others do too).</p>

<p>In the past 3 months, I have been able to retain more that I ever have before and it all just makes sense. In the past, things never seemed to connect. I could make things happen but nothing like now. I am actually releasing my site to the world and it is EXCITING!!!</p>

<p>I have a few projects lined out that should continue raise my confidence level. These projects will allow me to continue to learn new things but with deadlines involved., just like a developer would. It is exciting to know, this time, I stand a chance to make it!</p>
