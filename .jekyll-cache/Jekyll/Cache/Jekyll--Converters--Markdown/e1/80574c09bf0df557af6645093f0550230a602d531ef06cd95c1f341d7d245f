<p>Most of my life, I spent my quiet time coming up with ideas. Matter of fact, I have a ton of ideas. For those that know me well, I am a very analytical person.I analyze everything around me, constantly. When you meet me, I am very quiet. I am quiet because I am analyzing everything.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I hold myself back from speaking. I do this because I donâ€™t want to say something stupid. I lack confidence in social situations.</p>
