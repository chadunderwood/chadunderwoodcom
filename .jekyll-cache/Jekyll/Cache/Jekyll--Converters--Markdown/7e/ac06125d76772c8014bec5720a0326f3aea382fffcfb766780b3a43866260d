I"Õ<p>Easy to generate Favicons for everything at once. I came across this website <a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net/">Real Favicon Generator</a>. This allowed me to take my logo and upload it<!--more--> and then it did the lifting. I was prompted for some choices on how I wanted things to look. Next all I needed to do was click submit. Then I could download the results, which included a zip file of icons and the code to be input into the head of my site.</p>
