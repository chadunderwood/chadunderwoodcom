I"N<p>I finally got to a point where I need to manage 2 sets of code for my personal website page. I created my Dev environment today so I can work on new features without taking a chance on destroying my currently working code. In theory, I understood why you run 2 code sets but now that Iâ€™ve seen the branches in action it makes more sense.</p>

<p>All I had to do was create a second branch. This brought over my production code. From there all I needed to do was write new code and test it worked. Once I verified it was working, then I had to pull it into production. Easy, peasy!</p>
