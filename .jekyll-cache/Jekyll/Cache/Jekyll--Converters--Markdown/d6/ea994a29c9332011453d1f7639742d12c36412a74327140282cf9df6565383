<p>This journey started in High School. I knew I was going to work in tech. Tech was the one passion I have always had, specifically computers. I had taken every single computer class I could. Then came my senior year and Advanced MIS. I always excelled in MIS. I passed everything with 100%. Then came my final assignment.</p>

<p>All I had to do was build an application in VB (Visual basic for you young cats). I decided that I was going to make a black jack game.</p>
