I"<p>Over my years in tech, I’ve always said ”Search engines are your best friend for learning new things.” This has always held true but I’ve started hanging with a new pal.<!--more--> In the past six months, I have found myself turning to YouTube for answers.</p>

<p>If I need to find a specific error the search engine is where I go. However, I have turning to YouTube for everything else I need to learn. Truth be known I am an audible learner. YouTube not only helps with my learning style but I can find someone who explains things in a way that I can understand best. If only I could’ve picked my teachers in school.</p>

<p>In the past few months I’ve learned; yard maintenance, flower bed design and build, automated watering systems, photography, video editing and fixing my lawn mower. The world of learning new things is at your beckoned call but you have to remember it’s actually a resource. I always knew YouTube was there but I was a habitual search engine user. Then my relationship with the search engine got weird. I started more and more to remember to check YouTube before anything else. Now I rarely reach out to my old faithful friend. We still keep in touch from time to time, but it’s just not the same.</p>

<p>Please don’t take this as a never use a search engine, but more of a remember YouTube is the search engine for visual how to‘s. I bet you could save yourself a ton of time and money, if you turn to my new buddy, when something around your house breaks.</p>

<p>YouTube has become such a mature platform, that you can look up any topic and find anything you need or want to learn. I have yet to find any subject that I can’t a how-to or a review for. If you are and DIY’er or just don’t want to pay someone, YouTube should be your go to.</p>
