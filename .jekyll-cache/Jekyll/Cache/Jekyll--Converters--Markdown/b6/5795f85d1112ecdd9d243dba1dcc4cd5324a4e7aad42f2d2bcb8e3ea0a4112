I"ê<p>I created a launcher to link to certain things from my social media. This will allow me included links to multiple things from the bios in my social media. I started with squared corner divs and decided I wanted something that looked a little more like a button. This where I found the border radius property in CSS.</p>

 	<code class="highlighter-rouge">code</code> 
<p>border-radius: 15px;</p>
