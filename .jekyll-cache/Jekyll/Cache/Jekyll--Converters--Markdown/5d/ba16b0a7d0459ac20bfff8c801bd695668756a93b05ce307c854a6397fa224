I"º<p>I created a launcher to link to certain things from my social media. This will allow me included links to multiple things from the bios in my social media. I started with squared corner divs and decided I wanted something that looked a little more like a button. This where I found the border radius property in CSS. This allow you to set the amount the corners will be rounded. I am sure this is something I will need to use in the future a lot.</p>

 	`codeâ€™
<style>
   width: 100px; 
   height: 40px;
   background-color: black;
   border-radius: 15px;  

##### EXAMPLE
<div id="example" style="width: 100px; height: 40px; border-radius: 15px;background-color: black;">
